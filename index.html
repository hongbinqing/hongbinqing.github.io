  Hello! 你好！This is Hongbin QING, he/his. <br><br>
  
  Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://lt.cityu.edu.hk/">Department of Linguistics and Translation at City University Hong Kong</a>. I am now supervised by <a href="https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/person/jixingli">Dr. Jixing LI</a> and co-supervised by <a href="https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/person/ctckit">Prof. Chunyu KIT</a>. Now I am focusing on applying computational models to understand how the human brain represents and computes semantic information during language comprehension.<br><br>
  I got my M.S. in Computational Linguistics from <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/">University of Rochester</a>, and my B.A. in Chinese Language & Literature (minor in Computer Science) from <a href="https://en.scu.edu.cn/">Sichuan University</a>.<br><br>
  You can check my detailed information in <a href="https://hongbinqing.github.io/about.html">About</a> and download my CV <a href="CV.pdf">here</a>! <br>
