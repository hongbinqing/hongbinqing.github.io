  Hello! This is Hongbin QING, he/his. <br><br>
  
  I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://lt.cityu.edu.hk/">Department of Linguistics and Translation at City University Hong Kong</a>. I am now supervised by Dr. Li Jixing and co-supervised by Prof. Kit Chunyu. My research interests include computational linguistics and neurolinguistics. 
  
  I got my M.S. in Computational Linguistics from the University of Rochester, and my B.A. in Chinese Language & Literature (minor in Computer Science) from Sichuan University. You can check my detailed information in <a href="https://hongbinqing.github.io/about.html">About</a>! <br>
