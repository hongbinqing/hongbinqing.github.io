Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Linguistics and Translation at City University Hong Kong](https://lt.cityu.edu.hk/). I am now supervised by [Dr. Li Jixing](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/person/jixingli) and co-supervised by [Prof. Kit Chunyu](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/person/ctckit). Before that, I got my M.S. in Computational Linguistics from [University of Rochester](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/), and my B.A. in Chinese Language & Literature (minor in Computer Science) from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).

Now I am focusing on applying computational models to understand how the human brain represents and computes semantic information during language comprehension.
